# Flask-Based QA System with BERT

## Overview

This project demonstrates the integration of BERT's state-of-the-art question-answering capabilities into a Flask web application. The system extracts text from PDF documents and provides accurate answers to user queries using a pre-trained BERT model fine-tuned on the SQuAD dataset.

## Key Features

- **BERT for QA:** Utilizes the `deepset/bert-large-uncased-whole-word-masking-squad2` model for answering questions.
- **PDF Text Extraction:** Employs `pdfplumber` to extract and process text from PDFs.
- **Flask Web Interface:** Provides a user-friendly interface for querying and receiving answers.
- **Caching:** Implements caching to improve performance by storing previously computed answers.
